                <h3>You're the best thing that happened to me, baby. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you. 
                    No matter what comes our way, I’ll always be here for you, supporting you and loving you with all my heart. 
                    I love you more than words can say. Every day with you feels like a gift, and your kindness, strength, 
                    and love make my world brighter. You always know how to make me laugh, how to calm me when I'm stressed, 
                    and how to make me feel like the luckiest person alive.
                </h3>
